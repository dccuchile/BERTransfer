is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of consumer society instead anarchism and the state objection to the state and its institutions is sine qua non of anarchism anarchists consider the state as tool of domination and it is illegitimate regardless of political tendencies instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life major decisions are taken by small elite authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless if it is open or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people another anarchist argument against states is that some people constituting government even the most altruistic among officials will unavoidably seek to gain more power leading to corruption anarchists consider the argument that the state is the collective will of people as fairy tale since the ruling class is distinct from the rest of the society consistent with anarchist values is controversial subject among anarchists image is of leon czolgosz assassinating american president william mckinley anarchism and violence anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexed and controversial on one hand anarcho pacifists point out the unity of means and ends on the other hand other groups of anarchist are for direct action that can include sabotage or even terrorism emma goldman and errico malatesta who were proponents of limited use of violence were arguing that violence is merely reaction to state violence as necessary evil peace activist and anarchist april carter argues that violence is incompatible with anarchism because it is mostly associated with the state and authority as violence is immanent to the state as the state capability to exercise violence is colossal nowadays rebellion or civil war would probably end in another authoritarian institute anarchist strategies and tactics broad categorization would be the preference of revolutionary tactics to destroy oppressive states and institutions or aiming to change society through evolutionary means revolutionary methods can take violent form as they did in past insurgencies in spain mexico and russia or during violent protests by militant protestors such as the black bloc who are generally much less violent than revolutionary movements century ago anarchists also commonly employ direct action which can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchies or the form of self managing their lives through the creation of such as communes and non hierarchical collectives often decision making is handled in an anti authoritarian way with everyone having equal say in each decision an approach known as horizontalism another aspect of anarchist tactics is their aim to strengthen social bonds through common actions reclaiming public space by anarchists is another method of creating social spaces and creating squats in order to organise themselves during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied they are often called temporary autonomous zones criticism moral and pragmatic criticism of anarchism includes allegations of utopianism tacit and vandalism towards feats of civilisation allegation of utopianism anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics often in general and formal debate european history professor carl landauer argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is lesser evil than society without repressive force he also argued that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is an absurdity however an anarchist faq states the following anarchy is not utopia and anarchists make no such claims about human perfection remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods for example the use of juries mutual third parties or community and workplace assemblies it also states that some sort of court system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens industrial civilisation in his essay on authority friedrich engels claimed that radical promoted by anarchists would destroy modern industrial civilisation citing an example of railways and making the following point in the end it is argued that authority in any form is natural occurrence which should not be abolished tacit
